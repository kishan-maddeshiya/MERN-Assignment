Section 1: Git & GitHub
1. Git vs GitHub

Git is a distributed version control tool used locally to manage and track code changes. GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and allows developers to collaborate, review code, and manage projects. Git handles versioning, while GitHub provides collaboration features.

2. git clone, git fetch, git pull

git clone creates a local copy of a remote repository.
git fetch downloads new changes from the remote repository without updating the working branch.
git pull fetches changes and directly merges them into the current branch.

3. Merge conflict

A merge conflict happens when Git cannot automatically merge code changes from different branches. It is resolved by manually fixing conflicting code, removing conflict markers, testing the changes, and committing the final version.

4. git merge vs git rebase

git merge combines branches and keeps the full history with a merge commit.
git rebase applies commits on top of another branch to maintain a clean and linear history.

5. Purpose of .gitignore

.gitignore prevents unnecessary or sensitive files like node_modules, environment variables, and logs from being tracked by Git, keeping the repository clean and secure.

Section 2: MySQL & PostgreSQL
1. Difference between MySQL and PostgreSQL

MySQL is commonly used for simple and fast applications. PostgreSQL provides advanced features such as complex queries, JSON support, and strong data integrity, making it suitable for large-scale systems.

2. Primary key and foreign key

A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.
A foreign key connects two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.

3. WHERE vs HAVING

WHERE filters records before grouping and cannot use aggregate functions.
HAVING filters results after grouping and supports aggregate functions.

4. DELETE vs TRUNCATE

DELETE removes specific records and supports rollback.
TRUNCATE deletes all records quickly and resets identity values but cannot be rolled back.

5. Database normalization

Normalization organizes data to reduce duplication and improve consistency using rules like 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

6. Types of JOIN

INNER JOIN returns matching records from both tables.
LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table.
RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the right table.

7. Common SQL Commands

INSERT adds data.
SELECT retrieves data.
UPDATE modifies data.
DELETE removes data.
JOIN combines data from multiple tables.

Section 3: React Fundamentals
1. React overview

React is a JavaScript library used to build interactive and reusable UI components. It improves performance using a virtual DOM and is mainly used for single-page applications.

2. State vs Props

State is internal component data that can change.
Props are external values passed from parent to child components and are read-only.

3. React Hooks

Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext allow functional components to manage state, handle side effects, and share data.

4. useEffect

useEffect runs side effects such as API calls or subscriptions after rendering. Its execution depends on the dependency array.

5. Lifting state up

Lifting state up means moving shared state to a common parent so multiple components can access it.

Section 4: TypeScript Basics
1. TypeScript introduction

TypeScript is JavaScript with static typing, helping developers catch errors early and write more reliable code.

2. any vs unknown

any disables type checking.
unknown enforces type checking before use, making it safer.

3. Interfaces

Interfaces define object structure and ensure consistent data types.

4. Type inference

TypeScript automatically detects variable types based on assigned values.

5. Optional and readonly properties

Optional properties may be missing.
Readonly properties cannot be modified once set.

Section 5: General Web Development
1. REST API

REST APIs enable communication between client and server using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

2. PUT vs PATCH

PUT updates the entire resource.
PATCH updates only selected fields.

3. CORS

CORS controls cross-origin requests to protect server resources.

4. SQL vs NoSQL

SQL databases use structured schemas.
NoSQL databases are flexible and scalable.

5. MVC Architecture

MVC separates application logic into Model, View, and Controller, improving maintainability and scalability.
